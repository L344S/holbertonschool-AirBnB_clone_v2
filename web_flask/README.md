## Explanation of Flask

Flask is a micro-framework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2. It is designed to make the development of web applications quick and easy, with the ability to scale as needed.

## File List

- `0-hello_route.py`: A Python script that starts a Flask web application and defines a simple route.
- `1-hbnb_route.py`: A Python script that defines multiple routes in a Flask application.
- `2-c_route.py`: A Python script that uses variables in Flask routes.
- `3-python_route.py`: A Python script that uses Python as a variable in Flask routes.
- `4-number_route.py`: A Python script that uses a number as a variable in Flask routes.
- `5-number_template.py`: A Python script that uses Flask's `render_template` to display a HTML page.
- `6-number_odd_or_even.py`: A Python script that uses conditions in Flask templates.
- `templates`: This directory contains the HTML templates that your Flask application uses. These templates are used by the `render_template` function to generate the HTML that is sent to the client.
- `.gitignore`: A file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.
